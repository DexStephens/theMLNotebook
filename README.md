Taking time everyday in 2025 to better understand what ML foundations are, and how they are applied in Gen AI

Fundamentals of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning: uses labeled datasets to train artificial intelligence algorithm models to identify the underlying patterns and relationships between input features and outputs. Goal: create a model that can predict correct outputs on new real-world data

Workflow:

1. get training data
2. Assemble data with labels
3. Separate into groups: training data, validation data, and test data
4. Choose an algorithm with which to create the model
5. Feed training dataset to selected algorithm
6. Validate and test model accordingly
7. Watch model performance and maintain accuracy with regular updates

Types of Supervised Learning

- Classification: uses an algorithm to sort data into categories. Recognizes and attempts to label or define these entities. Algorithms include: linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor and random forest
- Regression: used to understand the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Algorithms include: linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression

- Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Vocabulary:

- Cross-Validation: the process of testing a model using a different portion of the dataset
- Data Bias: ???
- Algorithmic Bias: ???
- Dimensionality Reduction: reduces the number of features to those most crucial for predicting data labels, which preserves accuracy while increasing efficiency

Questions:

- How to regularly update supervised learning models?
- How do deep learning and machine learning relate?
- How to simply explain how neural networks work?
